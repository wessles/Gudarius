## A better version of Gradarius.
### 1st Place at Stevens CS Club Code Jam, 2018

*Gudarius* is a parody website of Gradarius, the online math-homework software. To be fair, Gradarius is the smoothest and best functioning math software I've ever used, yet it has caused me and other students enough grief that I created this. Enjoy!

This was made in less than 24 hours, and it shows in the code. Don't expect anything excessively pretty.

* Created in NodeJS / Express
* Used Guppy-js for math expression display / editor
* Graphics created by Jared Pincus
